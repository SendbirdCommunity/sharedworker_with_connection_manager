# Sendbird in a Shared Worker Example

Service runs a very simple version of Sendbird SDK v4 in a Shared worker.

- Provides comprehensive messaging example between tabs the shared worker and back in the context of Sendbird connectivity.
- Maintains a single connection to Sendbird in the SharedWorker regardless of tabs opened.
- Makes certain to disconnect when all tabs are closed.
- Handles changes in tab visibility including setting background state when no target tabs are visible.
- Handles rapid tab switching by not disconnecting during tab switch over.
- Handles duplicate tab events by not disconnecting during tab creation.
- Applies Sendbirdâ€™s own Connection Handler which also messages to all target tabs changes in the Sendbird connection, both during tab visibility changes and independently of tab visibility.
- Provides videos outlining the concepts.
